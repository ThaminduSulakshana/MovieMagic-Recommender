# MovieMagic-Recommender
A Collaborative Filtering and content-based Movie Recommendation System with Flask Interface

This repository contains a machine learning model for movie recommendation implemented using the Surprise library. The recommendation model is based on collaborative filtering and utilizes the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. Complementing the core model is a user-friendly Flask web application, that provides an interactive interface. Users can effortlessly input a movie name, triggering the system to deliver tailored recommendations. You can watch a live demonstration of the web application in action by following this [video link](https://vehiclealuepredictor.azurewebsites.net/).
